# NBA Today

NBA Today is a web application made using flask that displays games played on a given day.

## Built With

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - The web framework used
* [NBA_py](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py) - NBA API
* [Pygal](http://pygal.org/en/stable/index.html) - Sexy python charting (a python graph API)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Simple dimple html, css and javascript

## Website

I haven't published this website because all data from nba_py is from http://stats.nba.com/ and under their terms of use I am not allowed to display it without permission and so I don't intend on publishing this app.

## Examples

You can see the functionality of the nba app in this gif. If games haven't been played yet then the graphs display NAN. You can search for dates using the calendar in the search bar.
